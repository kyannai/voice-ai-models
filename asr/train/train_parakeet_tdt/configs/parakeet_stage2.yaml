# Notes:
# 1. Stage 2 training on malaysian-stt-stage2 dataset (~3.1M samples, ~6600 hours)
# 2. Uses finetuned stage 1 model as base (./models/full.nemo)
# 3. Effective batch size: 8 * 16 = 128
# 4. Learning rate 2e-4 (same as stage 1 - same domain, more data)
# 5. Steps per epoch: ~24,205 steps
# 5. GPU utilization: ~50-60GB with 8-bit optimizer + gradient checkpointing
# 6. 8-bit optimizer: Requires `pip install bitsandbytes` (auto-falls back if unavailable)
# 7. Gradient checkpointing enabled: 30-50% activation memory reduction, ~15% slower
# 8. Validation limited to 1k samples (speeds up eval checkpoints)
# 9. Memory optimization: PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True (set in run_training.sh)
# 10. Model automatically adds punctuation and capitalization
# 11. bf16 recommended for A100/H100 (better than fp16)
