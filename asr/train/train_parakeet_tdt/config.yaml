# Notes:
# 1. Config optimized for FULL DATASET training (~5.2M samples, ~4 days)
# 2. Effective batch size: 4 * 32 = 128
# 3. Learning rate 2e-4 proven working for Malaysian ASR
# 4. GPU utilization: ~50-60GB with 8-bit optimizer + gradient checkpointing
# 5. 8-bit optimizer: Requires `pip install bitsandbytes` (auto-falls back if unavailable)
# 6. Batch sizes: train=4, eval=2, grad_accum=32 (OOM-safe for full dataset)
# 7. Gradient checkpointing enabled: 30-50% activation memory reduction, ~15% slower
# 8. Validation limited to 1k samples (speeds up eval checkpoints)
# 9. Total steps: ~659,506 steps (actual from NeMo training dynamics)
# 10. Throughput: ~3.80 it/s → ~1.90 it/s with smaller batch + checkpointing
# 11. Checkpoints saved every 41,000 steps (~4x per day, ~6 hours)
# 12. Expected completion: ~96 hours (~4 days) with memory optimizations
# 13. Memory optimization: PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True (set in run_training.sh)
# 14. Model automatically adds punctuation and capitalization
# 15. bf16 recommended for A100/H100 (better than fp16)
